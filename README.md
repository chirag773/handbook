**`Please note that this is my personal overview on node ,this maybe not 100% correct`**

Wouldn't it be awesome if you only had to know one programming language for building a full stack application? Ryan Dahl put this thought into action and created Node.js. Node.js is a server side framework that is built upon Chrome's powerful V8 JavaScript engine. Though originally written in C++, it uses JavaScript to be used in applications.

See, problem solved. One language to rule them all. But this also brings you down to the fact that now your whole application is using the same language. That means you must have a sound knowledge of that language.


*If you write front end code, it shouldn’t be news that you could easily write web apps with NodeJs since both rely heavily on JavaScript.

It’s very important to understand that Node isn’t a silver bullet, it’s not always the best solution for every project. Anybody can start up a server in Node, but it takes a deeper understanding of the language to write web apps that scale.

Recently, I’ve been having a lot of fun with Node and I think I’ve learned enough to share, get feedback and learn more. Generally to cement my knowledge.
